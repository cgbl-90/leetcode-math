/*
Given an integer array nums of positive integers, return the average value of all even integers that are divisible by 3.

Note that the average of n elements is the sum of the n elements divided by n and rounded down to the nearest integer.

Sample

Input: nums = [1,3,6,10,12,15]
Output: 9
Explanation: 6 and 12 are even numbers that are divisible by 3. (6 + 12) / 2 = 9.
